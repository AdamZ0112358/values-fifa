**Analysis of the market value of footballers from the top 6 European leagues.**

The purpose of the study is to collect data using the web scraping technique, combine several data sets into one, and then attempt to build a model to predict the market value of players from the transfermarkt portal based on statistics proposed by the developers of the FIFA game and match statistics from the who_scored.



The first objective was to collect information on football players from the top 6 European leagues:
- Premier league - English league
- La liga - Spanish league
- Serie A - Italian league
- Bundesliga - German league
- League 1 - French league
- Liga NOS - Portuguese league



The webscrapping folder contains code that was used to retrieve data from 3 websites:
- https://www.transfermarkt.pl/
- https://sofifa.com/
- https://www.whoscored.com/

The data in the webscrapping file was also pre-cleaned and processed. The biggest challenge proved to be merging the three data sets. In each set, the players have slightly different names, which caused a lot of work.
The folder also contains the data files that were created during the work.
