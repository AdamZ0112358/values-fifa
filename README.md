The purpose of the study is to collect data using the web scraping technique, combine several data sets into one, and then attempt to build a model to predict the market value of players from the transfermarkt portal based on statistics proposed by the developers of the FIFA game and match statistics from the who_scored.





The webscrapping folder contains code that was used to retrieve data from 3 websites:
    -https://www.transfermarkt.pl/
    -https://sofifa.com/
    -https://www.whoscored.com/

The data in the webscrapping file was also pre-cleaned and processed. The biggest challenge proved to be merging the three data sets. In each set, the players have slightly different names, which caused a lot of work.
The folder also contains the data files that were created during the work.
