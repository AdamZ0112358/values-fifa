  The webscrapping folder contains code that was used to retrieve data from 3 websites:
-https://www.transfermarkt.pl/
-https://sofifa.com/
-https://www.whoscored.com/

  The data in the webscrapping file was also pre-cleaned and processed. The biggest challenge proved to be merging the three data sets. In each set, the players have slightly different names, which caused a lot of work.
The folder also contains the data files that were created during the work.
